# Reliably SLO Report Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for generating
your SLO report with [Reliably CLI](https://github.com/reliablyhq/cli).

You can use the Action as follows:

```yaml
name: Example to generate a SLO report
on: push
jobs:
  slo-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: reliablyhq/actions/slo-report@v1
      env:
        RELIABLY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELIABLY_TOKEN }}
        RELIABLY_ORG: ${{ secrets.RELIABLY_ORG }}
```

The Reliably SLO Report Action has properties which are passed to the underlying script.
These are passed to the action using `with`.

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| manifest | reliably.yaml | The location of the manifest file |
| format | simple | Format of the report generated by Reliably |
| output | | Write the report to a specific file path; if not specified, report is only printed to stdout |

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
